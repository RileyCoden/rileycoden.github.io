<h1>I Was Mercy</h1>
<h2>August, 2023</h2>
<pre>	
All we knew was the Haven. Our salvation lay in the Haven. Without this monolith, nicknamed during its construction as ‘Humanity's Last”, most here would be dead. Others, not even born. The Haven, home to thirteen-thousand residents; a huge structure of safety and life that had existed for over three generations. The bronze was all we were forced to know, although even with its downsides, it was life. Humanity itself was ungrateful for it. Still, even with the lack of thanks, you couldn't blame any resident for the restlessness The Haven seemed to engender in them.
